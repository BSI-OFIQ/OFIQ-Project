This folder contains model files needed to run OFIQ.
The files need to be downloaded from the 
[ISO-portal](https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/29794/-5/ed-1/en/OFIQ-MODELS.zip).
This is done automatically by the building scripts shipped with OFIQ.
The following folder structure shoulde placed directly here in this folder (not in
a sub-folder).
