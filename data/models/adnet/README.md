A file has to be downloaded manually and placed in this folder (i.e. \<OFIQ-PROJECT\>/data/models/adnet/). That is

* *[ADNet.onnx](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jkJ0VruvJJNtsBruqdUMxQwpWtA9dxkk)*

Note, after download, the name of the file may differ. You have to rename the file correspondingly.
