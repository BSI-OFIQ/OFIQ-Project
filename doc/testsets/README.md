# Test sets

The csv files in this folder specify the test sets used for evaluation of the candidate algorithms in the OFIQ report.

* In the csv file VGGFace2_image_pairs_for_EDC.csv, the mated image pairs of VGGFace2 used for computing the EDC curves are listed.
* In the other csv files, the images used from the public data base (specified in the name of the csv file) along with the ground truth labels are specified.

For Natural Colours and No Compression Artifacts, the test sets contain images from a public database (Colour FERET and FFHQ, respectively) that have been modified as specified in the OFIQ report. The parameters of the respective modification are encoded in the image file names listed in the corresponding csv file.
